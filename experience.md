# Work Experience

## Summary

During my time in the video game industry I worked in a team of software engineers on several large game development projects.
My initial PhD work was focused on algorithmic and method research and tool engineering.
During the last 2 years of my PhD I have been leading a small team of researchers, studying the DNA sequence level evolution of High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer.
The resulting manuscript is currently under revision at a top-tier biology journal.

#### Lab for Computational Biology at SFU

Developed methods for predicting and characterizing genomic rearrangements.
Published methods include deFuse for gene fusion discovery from RNA-Seq, Comrad and nFuse for predicting and characterizing gene fusions jointly from RNA-Seq and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), and CITUP for inferring clonal phylogenies from deep sequenced SNV data.
Unpublished methods include deStruct for predicting rearrangements from WGS and ReMixT for identifying rearrangements associated with subclonal copy number changes.

#### Shah Lab for Computational Cancer Biology

Currently leading a study of tumor evolution in High Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer.
Responsibilities include experiment design, bespoke tool development, data analysis, writing standard operating procedures, interfacing with biologists / technicians, and manuscript writing.

Additionally, developed and applied methods in collaboration with the Lab for Computational Biology at SFU.
These methods were used in studies of clonal evolution in breast cancer, prostate cancer and lymphoma.
