**Welcome to my personal pages!
I recently defended a Computing Science PhD at Simon Fraser University. 
I currently work in the Shah Lab for Computational Biology.**

 ***

# Summary

I returned to academics in 2008 after developing my skills as a software engineer in the video game industry.
During my PhD, I developed algorithms and software for analysis of sequence data, with specific focus on understanding genome rearrangements in cancer.

 ***

# Goal

To work on computational solutions with the potential to further our understanding of human disease.
Ideally, such work would take place in a highly collaborative environment with other computer scientists, biologists and medical doctors.
